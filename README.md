### Lab Tasks
- **Task 1: The primary objectives of this lab session are: Understanding image processing operations in Python. Extracting a specific region from an image. Converting an image to the HSV color space and analyzing its components. -**
	- **(a) Extracting a 100×100 Region from the Center of an Image, Load an image from a given URL. Determine the center coordinates of the image. Extract a 100×100 pixel region from the center. Display both the original and cropped image for comparison. ✓**
	- **(b) Converting an Image to HSV and Visualizing Components, Convert the input image from RGB to HSV color space. Extract and visualize the Hue, Saturation, and Value components individually in grayscale. Analyze how HSV representation differs from RGB.✓**
   
- **Task 2: Take a grayscale image of size 512x512 & perform the following operations –**
	- **(a) Differentiate the results of power law & inverse logarithmic transformation ✓**
	- **(b) Differentiate the results of power law & inverse logarithmic transformation ✓**
	- **(c) Find the difference image between original & the image obtained by last three MSBs ✓**
   
- **Task 3: Take a grayscale image of size 512x512, add some salt-and-pepper noise & perform the following operations –**
	- **(a) Apply average & median spatial filters with 5x5 mask & observe their performance for noise suppression in term of PSNR ✓**
	- **(b) Apply average filter with (3x3, 5x5, 7x7) mask with average filter & observe their performance in term of PSNR ✓**
	- **(c) Apply harmonic & geometric mean filter on the noisy image & compare their performance with PSNR ✓**
   
- **Task 4: Take a grayscale image of size 512x512, add some Gaussian noise & perform the following operations in the frequency domain –**
	- **(a) Apply 4th order Butterworth & Gaussian low-pass filter to analyze their performance quantitatively ✓**
	- **(b) Display the ringing effect of the ideal low-pass filter of different radius on the image ✓**
	- **(c) Perform edge detection of given the noisy & clean image using ideal & Gaussian high-pass filters ✓**
